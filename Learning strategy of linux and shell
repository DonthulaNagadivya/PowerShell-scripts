✅ Phase 1: Linux Basics (Foundation for Shell Scripting)

Before scripting, you must be comfortable with Linux:
File system navigation (ls, cd, pwd, tree)
File management (cp, mv, rm, cat, touch)
Permissions and ownership (chmod, chown, umask)
Process management (ps, top, kill, jobs, fg, bg)
System monitoring (df, du, free, uptime)
Networking basics (ping, netstat, curl, wget)

✅ Phase 2: Shell Scripting Fundamentals

Shell Types: bash, sh, zsh (focus on bash)

Script Basics:

Writing first script (#!/bin/bash)

Comments, execution permissions (chmod +x)

Variables:

Local and environment variables

export, read, set, unset

Quoting: Single vs Double quotes vs Backticks

Command Substitution: $(command) vs command

Exit Status: $?

---

✅ Phase 3: Operators & Control Flow

Arithmetic: expr, let, (( ))

Conditionals:

if-else, elif, case

Comparison operators: -eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -f, -d, -z

Loops:

for, while, until

break and continue

Test Conditions:

File test operators

String and numeric comparisons

---

✅ Phase 4: Functions & Advanced Scripting

Defining functions in bash

Positional parameters $0, $1, $#, $@, $*

Return values and exit codes

Scope of variables (local vs global)

Command line arguments

Debugging scripts (set -x, trap)

---

✅ Phase 5: File Handling & Text Processing

File I/O:

read, echo, cat, tee

Redirection: >, >>, <

Text Processing Tools:

grep, awk, sed, cut, sort, uniq

Regular Expressions (basic & extended)

Log parsing & automation (DevOps real-time use)

---

✅ Phase 6: Error Handling & Logging

Handling errors with ||, &&

trap for signals

Logging outputs to files

Writing scripts with error codes and retry logic

---

✅ Phase 7: DevOps-Specific Shell Scripting

Automation Tasks:

Creating users, managing permissions

Disk monitoring and cleanup scripts

Service Management:

Start/stop services (systemctl, service)

Backup & Restore scripts

CI/CD Integration:

Pre-build/post-build scripts in Jenkins/Azure DevOps

Cloud Automation:

Automating Azure CLI commands inside shell scripts

Docker & Kubernetes:

Automating container start/stop

Checking pod health and restarting pods using kubectl

Log Analysis:

Parsing logs for failures and sending alerts

---

✅ Phase 8: Advanced Concepts

Arrays and associative arrays

Here Documents and Here Strings

Job Scheduling:

cron jobs

at command

Parallel execution:

&, wait, xargs -P

Secure scripting (avoid plain-text passwords)

---

✅ Projects for DevOps Role

Write a script to monitor disk usage and send an alert when >80%.

Automate deployment of an app using scp + ssh + service restart.

Create a log monitoring script to detect errors and email the admin.

Develop a backup script for MySQL or application configs.

Build a script that checks Docker container health and restarts if needed.

Automate Azure resource creation using az CLI in bash scripts.
